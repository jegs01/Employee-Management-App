# Overview

This project is a console-based **Employee Management System** developed in C#. It was designed to help reinforce my understanding of object-oriented programming, file I/O, and data manipulation using C#.

The purpose of this software is to simulate a basic HR tool that allows users to add, display, edit, and persist employee records. This application gave me hands-on experience working with structs and classes, constructors, list collections, loops, and file handling in C#.

Through this project, I aimed to strengthen my problem-solving skills and deepen my familiarity with the C# syntax and .NET programming principles.
